# SVM Classifier for Cancer Dataset

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using the sklearn library to classify cancer data.

## Introduction

Support Vector Machines are powerful supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. In this project, we use an SVM classifier to predict whether a given tumor is malignant or benign using a well-known cancer dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from sklearn. This dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The goal is to classify tumors as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on these features.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.12
- sklearn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for data visualization, optional)

You can install sklearn, NumPy, and Matplotlib using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib
